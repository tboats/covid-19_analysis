# covid-19_analysis

This project aims to collect analyses to better understand the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020.  Some visualizations include:
- The raw number of infections/deaths for each country
- Computing the fraction of a country's population that is infected with the virus, then comparing countries based on this fraction
  - The aim here is to see "how many days away" one country is from another
  
The plan is to add analyses and notebooks in an ad-hoc fashion.

The data for this analysis provided by Johns Hopkins CSSE: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
